    <h3>WHERE I'VE BEEN</h3>
    <img src="" alt="View of Maui from Makawao" />
    <p>

      I am originally from Makawao, HI. I grew up surfing the beaches and
      exploring the jungles of the island of Maui. In my high school years
      my family was relocated to Albuqeruque, NM where I found a passion for
      CAD and engineering systems. For the next ten years I studied and
      worked in high-tech manufacturing, opening more opportunities for
      myself and moving again to Colorado, eventually settling in downtown
      Louisville. Here I enjoy every mountain sport there is and living life
      with my friends and family that I've found here.

    <h3>WHAT I'M DOING</h3>
    <img src="" alt="generic screen of VScode" />
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer, machinist and maker. Fueled by my beliefs
      that aesthetics and user experience are an essential integration to
      everything we make or use, I bring a unique approach to design in
      everything I do. Currently a student at Thinkful, I'm learning the
      skills to create powerful, user-friendly applications for machine and
      server interfaces with limitless applications. My extensive experience
      in manufacturing ensures I will understand the challenges your
      business faces and create a tailor- made solution that will maximize
      your efficiency. It is my personal mission to create tools that push
      businesses to be competitive at the next level, whether its a small
      shop looking to expand or a business of thirty years.

    <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO DO</h3>
    <img src="" alt="Image of Starlink" />
    <p>
      Through everything I have and will do, I aspire to be the best
      designer and human being I can be. I hope to use all of my skills and
      experience to contribute to deepening our knowledge of the cosmos,
      working with a talented team of developers to create applications and 
      software to support the aerospace industry and all applicable applied 
      sciences. Increasing the level of our world's technology means 
      increasing the opportunities and quality of life available to everyone 
      and a great deal of these technologies have come from the continued 
      development of space exploration programs.

  <h2>QuizApp</h2>
  
  <a href="https://lstribli.github.io/QuizApp/" target="_blank"><img src="" alt="QuizApp Screenshot"></a>
  <p>
  This fully-interactive web app is one of the first projects I built in Jquery during my coursework at Thinkful.
  The app was built in one day, at the end of the first week.

  <h2>Society's Playground</h2>
  <p>
   I built this website using Jquery as a side project for a server on "Rust," one of the most-played games on Steam.
   The site and server itself are both a WIP however the server is fully-playable and deployed.
